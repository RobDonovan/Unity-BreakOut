# Unity Breakout Demo

An example of the Atari game [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game))

You can clone, copy or modify any of this code however you want. It is under the [GNU General Public License.](/LICENSE) 

This demo is more to show how to structure code at a basic level, rather than a fully developed game.

It has 6 playable levels with 3 collectables: PowerBall, Triple Ball & Bat Rocket

New Levels, Bricks and Collectables can easily be created inside the Unity editor as Prefabs and setup is controlled in the GameData folder

It was originally created in Unity 2020.3.8f1 but should work in most versions

## Game Play
Bounce the ball around until all coloured blocks are removed.

## Controls
Use `LEFT` and `RIGHT` arrow keys (or `A` & `D`) to move the paddle.
Use `SPACE` or `LEFT MOUSE BUTTON` to fire rocket
